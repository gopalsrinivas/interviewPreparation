1) Python Data Types
Ans)
Numeric = int, float, complex
String = string
Sequence = list,tuple,range
Binary = bytes,bytearray,memorryview
Mapping = dictionary
Boolean = boolean
Set = set,frozenset
None = NoneType

2) Django architecture
Ans) 
Models: It describes database schema and data structure.
------
Views: It controls what a user sees, the view retrieves data from appropriate models 
------     and executes any calculation made to the data and pass it to the template.
Templates: It determines how the user sees it. It describes how the data received from 
----------     the views should be changed or formatted for display on the page.

3) What is Decorators ?
Ans)
  A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and adds functionality 
    or augments the function without changing it. 
 These built-in decorators are used when decorating function-based views.
syntax:
---------
@decorator_name
example:
------------
def my_decorator(func):
   def wrapper():
       print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
       func()
       print("Something is happening after the function is called")
    return wrapper
    
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

4) Explain Django’s Request / Response Cycle.
Ans)
• A request is received by the Django server.
• The server looks for a matching URL in the urlpatterns defined for the project.
• If no matching URL is found, then a response with 404 status code is returned. 
• If a matching URL is found, the corresponding code in the view file associated with the URL is executed.
• The executed code in the view builds and sends a response back to the client.

5) What is Middleware and use of Middleware in django ?
Ans)
Middleware Definition:
-----------------------
• Middleware is a layer in Django's Request/Response processing pipeline.
• Each middleware is responsible for specific functions on the request and/or response, like caching or Gzipping.
Use of Middleware:
-----------------------
• Middleware in Django is a lightweight plugin processing requests and responses.
• Performs functions like security, CSRF protection, session management, and authentication.
• Django supports various built-in middleware for common tasks.

Example Middleware:
-------------------
class MyCustomMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # Code to execute before the view is called
        response = self.get_response(request)
        # Code to execute after the view is called
        return response

MIDDLEWARE = [
  'path.to.MyCustomMiddleware',
]

6) What is Django ORM ?
Definition:
----------
Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a database abstraction API in Django.
Allows interaction with database models, performing actions like add, delete, modify, and query objects.

7) What is difference between mutable and immutable objects
Mutable
--------
• Mutable Can be modified after creation.
• Mutable slower to access
• Mutable consumes more memory due to mutability.
• Dictionary, Sets, Lists

  Example:
  --------
    Dictionary : 
    -------------
        country_capitals = {
            "United States": "Washington D.C.", 
            "Italy": "Rome", 
            "England": "London"
        }
   
    Sets : 
    -------
      my_set = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
      print(my_set)
      o/p: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

    List :
    -------
      age = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
      print(age)
      o/p : [1,2,3,4,5,6] 
   
Immutable
----------
• Immutable Cannot be modified after creation.
• Immutable quicker to access
• Immutable consumes less memory.
• str, tuple,Int,float, bool, frozenset, bytes

    > Lists,tuple,str,bytes = Ordered
    > Dictionary,Sets,frozenset = Unordered

8) Difference Between List and Tuple
Ans
---
List
------
• Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]
• Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.
• Lists are slower than tuples.
• Lists Consume more memory.
• Lists have several built-in methods
• The List is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion

Tuple
------
• Syntax: tup_1 = (10, "Chelsea", 20)
• Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can't be edited).
• Tuples are faster than list.
• Tuple consumes less memory
• Tuple does not have many built-in methods
• Tuple data type is well-suited for element access.

9) Difference between SQL and NOSQL 
SQL
-------
• SQL databases are categorized as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
• SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.
• SQL databases are vertically scalable.
• SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.
• SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.
• MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database.

NOSQL
-------
• NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system
• NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.
• NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
• NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.
• NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.
• MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database

10) What is a Python interpreter
Ans) The Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code.
      It reads and interprets Python scripts or commands line by line and carries out the instructions.

11) What Python map() Function
Ans) The map() function executes a specified function for each item in an iterable. 
         The item is sent to the function as a parameter.
Syntax:
---------
map(function, iterable)
parameters:
-----------
function: It is a function in which a map passes each item of the iterable.
iterable: It is a sequence, collection or an iterator object which is to be mapped.
Example:
-----------
# Python example program for map() function
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
# lambda function defines the squaring operation  
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x:x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)
o/p: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

12) What is Python Lambda ?
Ans) A Lambda function is small anonymous function.
      A Lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. 
      syntax:
      -------
      lambda argument:expression
      Example:
      ----------
      x = lambda a:a+10
      print(x(5))

13) What is namespace in Python ?
Ans) A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts. 

14) csv and pdf file librarys in Python
Ans) > import csv or import pandas as pd
     > import PyPDF2 and from fpdf import FPDF

15) What is serialization in Django
Ans) Serialization is the process of converting Django models into other formats such as XML, JSON, etc. 

16) Explain Q objects in Django ORM 
Ans) When writing complex queries, Q objects are employed because filter () functions only allow you to 'AND' the conditions;
       whereas Q objects allow you to 'OR' the conditions.
       example:
       --------
          from django.db.models import Q

          q1 = Q(name__startwith='A')
          q2 = Q(age__gte=18)
          
          # AND operation
          result = YourModel.objects.filter(q1 & q2)

          # OR operation
          result = YourModel.objects.filter(q1 | q2)

17) Explain the migration in Django and Explain the use of ‘migrate’ command in Django ?
Ans) 
Migration in Django is to make changes to models like deleting a model, adding a field, etc. into database schema. 
There are several commands you use to interact with migrations.
•	Migrate
•	Makemigrations		
•	Sqlmigrate
To do the migration in SQL, you have to print the SQL statement for resetting sequences for a given app name.
django-admin.py sqlsequencereset
Use this command to generate SQL that will fix cases where a sequence is out sync with its automatically incremented field data.

migrate:
-------
• The migrate command is basically used to apply or unapply migrations changes made to the models.
• This command basically synchronizes the current set of models and migrations with the database state.
• We can use this command with or without parameters.
• In case you do not specify any parameter, all apps will have all their migrations running.

18) What is rest api in python ?
Ans) REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
      It is a way for two pieces of software to communicate with each other.
      REST APIs are used to create "web services" in HTTP requests, which provide data between client and server applications.
      HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs:
      ----------------------------------
      GET: Used to retrieve data from a specified resource.
      POST: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
      PUT: Used to update a current resource with new data.
      DELETE: Used to request the removal of a resource.
      PATCH: Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
      HEAD: Similar to GET but used to retrieve only the headers, not the actual data.
      OPTIONS: Used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
      TRACE: Used to perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target 

19) What is Json ?
Ans)
Data Interchange Format: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used for structuring and transmitting
-------------------------       data between a server and a client.
Human-Readable and Machine-Readable: It is easy for both humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate.
------------------------------------     The format is text-based and consists of key-value pairs.
Widely Used in Web Development: JSON is commonly used in web development for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to exchange data between a web server and a client, 
------------------------------      and it is supported by many programming languages.

20). How you can create a project in Django
Ans)
django-admin startproject projectName
py manage.py startapp appName

21) What are the features available in Django?
Ans)
• Admin Interface (CRUD)
• Templating
• Form handling
• Internationalization and Localization
• Session, user management, role-based permissions
• Object-relational mapping (ORM)
• Testing Framework
• Fantastic Documentation
• Middleware Support

• Testing Support

22) What is index in database ?
Ans) 
• The index is a type of data structure. It is used to locate and access the data in a database table quickly.
• Indexing is used to optimize the performance of a database by
        minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed.
